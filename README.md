# Introduction
This is a toy repository for exploring AI Agents in games during spare time. Currently, I'm working on building AI Agents in the Minecraft World.

# RoadMap

## M1 - Basic Infrastructure

In this phase of the project, the focus is on controling MC World through API. This is the foundation for researching AI Agents in Minecraft.

## M2 - A Beginner's Exploration of Reinforcement Learning
Study previous work in AI Agent, especially in MC Agent. Attempt to reproduce them in my own environment. 

## M3 - Make an ecosystem built by a group of people.
Further the study and explore whatever I like.
